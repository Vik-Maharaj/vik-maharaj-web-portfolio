# Vik Maharaj's Web Portfolio

## Description

When applying for web development positions, an employer wants to know about the candidate, and more importantly, wants to see what the candidate has done. So, having an online portfolio is essential.

Enter the purpose of this project: Since I don’t have one, I need to create a portfolio that I can link to in my resume and future job applications, so that an employer can view from any web browser.  

To accomplish this, the portfolio was created with the following features:

- At the top of the webpage, the page loads with my name and links to sections about me, my skills, my portfolio samples, and how to contact me.
- Following the section links at the top, there is a recent picture.
- There is a skills section that highlights some of my skills along with a picture representation of those items.
- The portfolio page of the website features images of the work samples, and when clicked, takes the user to the deployed websites of those samples.
- The contact section has external links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, along with an email form for future use.
- The entire webpage can be viewed on any device, and presents a responsive layout that can adapt to any viewport.
- The webpage also contains user interactivity that allows certain images to change in color or appearance once the mouse hovers over it.

An online portfolio is never complete, and can be continually updated once new projects are accomplished. But before that can happen, an initial version has to be created, and now with this initial portfolio I have something to promote and build from.
